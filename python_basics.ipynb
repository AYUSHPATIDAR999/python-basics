        "\n",
        "Q1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "    Python is a high-level programming language that is easy to learn & easy to use and has a large libraries. It is widely used in data science, web devleopment due to simple syntax.\n",
        "  \n",
        "Q2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "    An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and runs Python code line by line, converting it into commands that a machine can understand and then carrying them out.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "    predefined keywords in Python are special words that the programming language already knows and uses for specific tasks.\n",
        "    here is list of some python keywords are\n",
        "    Here are some examples of Python's predefined keywords:\n",
        "    if\n",
        "    for\n",
        "    def\n",
        "    true and false\n",
        "    class\n",
        "    import\n",
        "    while\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "    No, Python does not allow the usage of keywords as variable names, Python will display a syntax error if you attempt to use a keyword as the name of a variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "    Mutability in Python refers to whether an object can be changed after it is created\n",
        "    their are two types of mutablity\n",
        "    >Mutable objects can be modified after they are created.\n",
        "    >Immutable objects cannot be changed after they are created.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "    Python lists are mutable because they serve as collections of things that are subject to change over time, allowing actions for example element adding, deleting, and modifiying. However, because tuples are designed to represent fixed collections of data that shouldn't be changed once they are created, they are immutable.  Tuples are helpful when you need constant values,so lists and tuples differ from one another due to efficiency and requirments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "    == checks for value equality.\n",
        "    is checks for object identity whether two variables refer to the same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "    Their are three types of logical operators are:\n",
        "    and- True if both conditions are true.\n",
        "    or- True if at least one condition is true.\n",
        "    not- Reverses the result of a condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "    Type casting in Python refers to the process of converting one data type to another. Python give two types of type casting are\n",
        "    Implicit casting happens automatically when converting from a smaller to a larger data type.\n",
        "    Explicit casting is done manually using functions like int(), float(), and str().\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "    The difference between implicit and explicit type casting\n",
        "    Implicit- done automatically, typically when moving from a smaller to a larger data type (e.g., from int to float)\n",
        "    Explicit- done manually by the programmer using type conversion functions (e.g., int(), str())\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "    Python's conditional statements allow a program select what to do based on particular situations.  By performing different code blocks based on whether a condition is true or false, they helps in managing the program's flow.  For example, a `if` statement checks if a condition is true and runs the code accordingly, while `else` and `elif` provide alternative actions for when the condition is false or when you need to check multiple conditions.  This makes the program more flexible and dynamic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "    Multiple conditions can be checked after a `if` statement in Python using the `elif` statement.  The program shows the condition in the `elif` step if the `if` condition is false.  Its code is run if that condition is true.  Multiple `elif` statements are allowed, and the program will check every one simultaneously.  The `else` block, if it is present, will run if none of the requirements are true.  This makes it possible to verify multiple requirements in a clear and systematic manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "    the difference betwen for and while loop are:\n",
        "    for loop is used when you know the number of iterations in advance.\n",
        "    while loop is used when you want the loop to continue as long as a certain condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        "    when asking a user to enter a correct password, you don't know how many attempts it will take, so a `while` loop would keep prompting the user until the correct input is provided. In contrast, a `for` loop is better suited for situations where the number of iterations is fixed or known in advance is best example to understand the scenario for while loop.\n"
